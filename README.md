# GeneratePress child theme

This is a child theme for the [GeneratePress](https://generatepress.com/) WordPress theme. I found myself using the same conventions over and over, so I thought it would be best standardize and include them here.

If you've never heard of GeneratePress, it's a solid, flexible, and lightweight "framework" theme that allows developers to get the most common components up and running quickly. It also includes lots of [hooks](https://generatepress.com/knowledgebase/hook-list/) and [filters](https://generatepress.com/knowledgebase/filter-list/) to help customize and extend.

GeneratePress itself is free, but I highly recommend the [premium add-ons](https://generatepress.com/premium/). It's easily money well spent.

## Video Overview

I've posted an overview video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/sDia_U0fNyU (it's about 35 minutes)

## What's included

I've tried to be thorough with comments at the top of each file, but here's the gist of it.

### CSS

First, there is `base.css` within the `css` folder, and just as it's named, its only purpose is to provide some "base" styles not already included in GeneratePress. Much of it is pulled from [Basscss](http://basscss.com/), but I've modified and added here and there to make it more in line with GeneratePress styling.

Secondly, there is also `gutenberg.css` where I've decided to place all Gutenberg-specific styling. You may easily inlcude these in the main `style.css` file, but I prefer to keep them separate and use a plugin like [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/) to merge them all together at launch.

GeneratePress implements [Unsemantic](http://unsemantic.com/) for its layout styling. The additional [default styling](https://github.com/tomusborne/generatepress/blob/master/style.unmin.css) is on Github.

The `style.css` file is where I include all of my custom styling. I have not included any preprocessor setup, so feel free to rig up whatever you prefer.

#### Default Color Classes

**NOTE:** This all now happens automagically with the release GeneratePress 3.1. Thank you, Tom and team!

Any custom colors added to the `$gpc_theme_colors` array in `inc/colors.php` will now be added as both CSS properties (like variables) and WordPress color classes (i.e. `has-dark-gray-color`). Let's say you add a custom color called "Dark Gray." The CSS will look something like this:

```css
:root {
    --dark-gray:#666666;
}

.has-dark-gray-color,
.wp-block-button__link.has-text-color.has-dark-gray-color {
    color:#666666;
}

.has-dark-gray-background-color {
    background-color:#666666;
}
```

This all happens in `inc/styles.php`. Outlined button classes are also added based on the button colors assigned in GeneratePress:

```css
.button.button-outline,
.button.button-outline:visited,
.woocommerce .button.button-outline,
.woocommerce .button.button-outline:visited {
    border-color:#3580b2;
    color:#3580b2;
}

.button.button-outline:hover,
.button.button-outline:focus,
.woocommerce .button.button-outline:hover,
.woocommerce .button.button-outline:focus {
    border-color:#3f3f3f;
    color:#3f3f3f;
}
```

#### Entrance Animation Classes

A few small animations classes are now included in `styles.css` that let you fade in elements in a few different ways. You can even use the "Advanced > CSS Classes" field in the WordPress editor. For example:

- Fade in element on page load: `fade-in prep-animation`
- Fade in element from bottom when it scrolls into view: `scroll-fade-in-bottom prep-scroll-animation`

If you're fading in multiple items, you may want them to fade in one at a time. The you can use the `delay-` classes. Like so:

- Fade in after 250 ms: `fade-in-right delay-250 prep-animation`

Check out the ANIMATIONS portion of `styles.css` to learn more.

**Update:** The `scroll-fade-in` classes will now also work if an element is already in within the viewport. If it is NOT within the viewport, the animation will wait until it is to play. The scripts will check for animations on both scroll and page load events. Technically, you could use the `scroll-fade-in` classes for everything and they will work.

### JavaScript

**No longer requires jQuery!** Only one JavaScript file is present, `js/scripts.js`, for all of my javascript goodies. As of now it only includes some stuff to make the animation CSS classes work.

### Functions

The `functions.php` file and everything within the `inc` folder go together. You'll find the usual within `functions.php`, but the `inc` folder includes some optional files that can be "required" as needed.

It will probably be easiest to check the comments in each file to find out what's going on, but basically, it's:

- `advanced-custom-fields.php`: Helpers for Google Maps and Gutenberg blocks in Advanced Custom Fields
- `breadcrumbs.php`: Add a simple visual breadcrumb trail using hooks (Note that this does not add stuctured data &mdash; I recommend a plugin like [SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/) for that)
- `colors.php`: ~~Allows you to add your own colors to the color fields used by GeneratePress, and now Gutenberg. UPDATE: Now all theme colors are pulled from a single array. Several CSS color classes are also added automatically.~~ No longer necessary thanks to GP 3.1!
- `cpt-output-custom.php`: Tells custom post types and taxonomies to use specified template partials (stored within `partials`)
- `cpt-output-reset.php`: ~~Heads off the default display of custom post types and taxonomies so that our custom partials can be used instead~~ This is no longer necessary thanks to the Elements Module introduced in GP Premium 1.7
- `dashboard-widgets.php`: Where my dashboard widgets live
- `fonts.php`: ~~Font-related functions for GeneratePress. Here are the beginnings of a method that allows the inclusion of fonts in the Customizer outside of Google Fonts (or including missing Google Fonts).~~ No longer necessary thanks to GP 3.1!
- `generateblocks.php`: **NEW!** You can now set defaults for GenerateBlocks! This file currently contains the code to sync up GenerateBlocks' button styling with GeneratePress, but you can do more. For all available options, take a look at the [default settings](https://github.com/tomusborne/generateblocks/blob/master/includes/defaults.php) in GenerateBlocks.
- `generatepress.php`: Some customizations for GeneratePress. I've updated some things here for GP 2.0.
- `helper-functions.php`: Home for any helpful functions that need to be accessible from anywhere in the child theme
- `image-sizes.php`: Optional custom image sizes
- `optimizations.php`: Some stuff to make our site lean and mean
- `shortcodes.php`: Where my shortcodes live
- `styles.php`: ~~Creates additional inline styles from colors set within the customizer of GeneratePress. UPDATE: Now pulls from colors in `inc/colors.php` to generate custom color properties and standard WP color classes automatically.~~ Just use global styles in GenerateBlocks Pro. It's much easier.
- `sub-menu-widget.php`: Creates a contextual sub menu widget that pulls from the specified menu theme location. Defaults to `primary`.
- `sub-menu.php`: Function for adding contextual sub menus. Used by `sub-menu-widget.php`.
- `users.php`: Currently defines what the admin looks like for the `editor` and `shop_manager` roles. Requires the [Members plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) by Justin Tadlock.
- `widgets.php`: Easily hide unwanted widgets.
- `woocommerce.php`: Customizations, if necessary, for WooCommerce.
- `wp-show-posts.php`: Customizations, if necessary, for [WP Show Posts](https://wpshowposts.com/). This currently only contains a filter for removing all links for occasions where you only require a list (but not links, obviously).

### Partials

Within `partials` you'll find a couple of sample template files for setting up a custom layout for custom post types. I prefer this method (for now, anyway) instead of the [template hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) convention so that my template files won't necessarily require tweaking as the result of a theme update. This may be dumb, so I'll revisit if that's the case.

These partials are called from within `inc/cpt-custom-output.php` and sometimes `inc/shortcodes.php`.

### Template-parts

The `template-parts` folder is much like the `partials` folder, but it's more organized. I now try to use this folder to organize all of my Gutenberg block templates and shortcode templates.

### Screenshot

I've included an [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) file to create the `screenshot.png` for the child theme. Of course you can use whatever you like to make your 1200x900 PNG or JPEG file to suit your needs.

### Other

#### GenerateBlocks for general page layout

Amazing new blocks plugin from the GeneratePress guys. If you like page builders, you need to at least give this a try. Check out this [introductory video](https://youtu.be/V6TzewpRxQ0) and [download GenerateBlocks](https://generateblocks.com/) now.

#### How I use the Members plugin

To enable the settings I have in place for the Editor role, all that currently needs to be done is to enable the "Edit Theme Options" under "Appearance" for the Editor role (start by looking under Users > Roles in WordPress). This will enable Menus and Widgets for Editors in WordPress.

#### Margin fix for Lightweight Grid Columns

(NOTE: I'm phasing this out thanks to Gutenberg blocks.) Still a good plugin, but [GenerateBlocks](https://generateblocks.com/) is far better.
